# Capstone-2

This repository contains all code and documentation for my AirBnB Fairfinder project. 

This was originally a project done for Springboard using Python and Flask. I have come back to the project to turn it into a workable website using React as the frontend. The backend is also getting an upgrade to FastAPI, the work done for the machine learning portion remains the same.
